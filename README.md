# CA Coast Sea-Level Rise Python Data Project Report

## 1. Introduction

Which coastal California counties are most at risk from sea-level rise? <br />
This is the environmental research question that this Python programming project seeks to answer.

<p>
The development strategy centers on fetching JSON data from the publicly available API 
of risks from sea-level rise courtesy of the CA Coastal Commission 
(<a href="https://www.coastal.ca.gov/open-data/api-docs/">https://www.coastal.ca.gov/open-data/api-docs/</a>)
and using core Python features to process, visualize, and analyze this data.
Additional datapoints will be extracted from PDF risk assessment files for each coastal California counties.
